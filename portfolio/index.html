				<b>Scoren met Sporen</b> <br>
				My graduation project for ProRail. This game was created by a team of 12 people (10 programmers, 2 artists). It was made with Monogame as its framework, using C#. 
				We used the Scrum approach to have every member of the team be able to contribute properly. <br>
				This game translates a boardgame to a digital format. It is used internally by ProRail to teach new employees about the responsibilities of the company. 
				My biggest responsibility during the project was the in-game level editor. During this project I learned a lot about the importance of high code quality. 
				Whenever the project lacked in this aspect, making changes to the game's logic became impossible. Thus, the code quality was held in high regard, which is something that has stuck with me since. <br>

				<b>Testzone</b> (<a href="https://github.com/FrankToonen/Testzone" target="_blank">github link</a>) <br>
				A game that was made during my Game Design minor. The theme was 'Design for space', in which spatial challenges were the goal of the design. It was made using C# in Unity3D. 
				I was the lead (and sole) programmer of the project, in addition to assisting in Game Design.
				During this project I learned a lot about Unity. Looking back at it, I'm not entirely pleased with the code quality. I feel I have improved tremendously in this aspect since.<br>
