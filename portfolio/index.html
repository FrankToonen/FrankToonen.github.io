				<b>Scoren met Sporen</b> <br>
				My graduation project for ProRail. This game was created by a team of 12 people (10 programmers, 2 artists). It was made with Monogame as its framework, using C#. 
				We used the Scrum approach to have every member of the team be able to contribute properly. <br>
				This game translates a boardgame to a digital format. It is used internally by ProRail to teach new employees about the responsibilities of the company. 
				My biggest responsibility during the project was the in-game level editor. During this project I learned a lot about the importance of high code quality. 
				Whenever the project lacked in this aspect, making changes to the game's logic became impossible. Thus, the code quality was held in high regard, which is something that has stuck with me since. <br>

				<b>Testzone</b> (<a href="https://github.com/FrankToonen/Testzone" target="_blank">github link</a>) <br>
				A game that was made during my Game Design minor. The theme was 'Design for space', in which spatial challenges were the goal of the design. 
				It's a online free-for-all game in which four player's are pitched against each other in a test facility for physics-based gadgets. It was made using C# in Unity3D and the build-in UNet networking. 
				I was the lead (and sole) programmer of the project, in addition to assisting in Game Design.
				During this project I learned a lot about Unity. Looking back at it, I'm not entirely pleased with the code quality. I feel I have improved tremendously in this aspect since.<br>

				<b>Megamen</b> <br>
				The introduction project during my first year of my bachelor. It was made using C# in XNA and the Lidgren networking library. 
				During this project I was eager to learn programming, which resulted in me taking on a lot of responsibilities.
				I implemented the character controls, enemy AI and online co-op. 
				I was also responsible for the sound design, creating all SFX and the OST myself using FL Studio.<br>

					<b>Laser Relay</b> WIP (<a href="https://github.com/FrankToonen/LaserRelay" target="_blank">github link</a>) <br>
						A puzzle game for mobile. Technically finished, but requires some more work in areas that are not within my expertise (art, sound).
						The goal is to move the blocks to deflect a laser towards a target. Moving the blocks will rotate them. 
						The 'nodes' these blocks land on can have different types of behaviour, such as teleporting the player or being destroyed after a player has stepped on them.

						<b>Spellcaster</b> WIP (<a href="https://github.com/FrankToonen/Spellcaster" target="_blank">github link</a>) <br>
						A turn-based RPG game on mobile for which I have implemented flexible battle system. 
						The initial idea is to have the player perform attacks by drawing patterns. This system has been made, but not yet implemented in the prototype. 
						It is made in Unity3D using C#.

						<b>Left 4 Dead 2 map</b> (<a href="http://www.gamemaps.com/details/6056" target="_blank">download link</a>) <br>						
						Before getting into programming, I was doing Level design for <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i> and <i>Counter-strike: Source</i>. This is one of the only maps I have left to show of that. <br>
