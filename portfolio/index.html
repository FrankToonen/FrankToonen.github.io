			<b>Scoren met Sporen</b> <br>
			My graduation project for ProRail. This game was created by a team of 12 people (10 programmers, 2 artists). It was made with Monogame as its framework, using C#. The project used Scrum in order to meet deadlines and divide the workload properly. This game translates a boardgame to a digital format. It is used internally by ProRail to teach new employees about the responsibilities of the company. My biggest responsibility during the project is the in-game level editor. <br>
